# Requirements

The provided binaries are compatible with brave browser on 64-bit linux-based operating system (filename : comma) and any browser (the one set as default) on 64-bit windows operating system (filename : comma.exe).  
If you wish to use the program in operating system or browser not mentioned above, feel free to compile, and modify the source code as needed.

# Usage

Before using Comma, make a plain text file in the same directory named list.txt in the following format :
shortcut0 url0
shortcut1 url1
shortcut2 url2
and so on ...

example :  
wiki https://www.wikipedia.org/  
In list.txt, the line above will set the program to open https://www.wikipedia.org/ when it reads the input "wiki" from the user  

You can use this program to access frequently accessed websites' url. For students, this is very helpful if there are many virtual classrooms with different urls to keep up everyday.
