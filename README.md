# Comma

Comma : Command Of Managing Missions and Assignments is a project to make accessing links and website easier by launching it from command line.

# Usage

Before using Comma, make a plain text file in the same directory named list.txt in the following format :
shortcut0 url0
shortcut1 url1
shortcut2 url2
and so on ...

example :
wiki https://www.wikipedia.org/
In list.txt, the line above will set the program to open https://www.wikipedia.org/ when it reads the input "wiki" from the user

You can use this program to access frequently accessed websites' url. For students, this is very helpful if there are many virtual classrooms with different urls to keep up everyday.
